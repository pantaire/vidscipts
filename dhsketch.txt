Doodle timelapse and 3D ideas
(Dont downplay drawings, it's just another form of art)


Hey guys, let's doodle a little together. What i'm drawing today are just some very simple doodles of my own character in WoW, who is a blood elf demon hunter. 

I figured i would use this painting timelapse for a quick status update with what's going on in my life and where this channel will be headed for the future. 

First disclaimer: If you're wondering when there will be Blender tutorials, fret not, there will be in the future. This channel is called Taire 3D for a reason. 


With all the things going on in the world right now, my creativity has been running WILD. I'm having so many ideas for so many different things and different contexts. 
I've been developing complete short films in my head, wanting to start a webcomic (actually, two separate webcomics which might merge later on into one), and a hell of a lot of ideas for drawings and 3D models. 
Which would not really be bad per se, because making things is great, and creating art is my hobby - but focusing on one single idea and sticking with it till it's done? That's hard, man. 

Finishing a project is such a great thing, you got these feelings of achieving something and getting to show the world the cool new thing you have done. But getting there? 


Let's be honest: 3D modeling takes more time and dedication than just throwing together a few paint layers and calling it a day. 
Which is great for me, because the next day, there are new ideas and yesterdays ideas are just not worth it anymore. 
So that's why there is more


I am currently starting wayyy too many new projects,
