Jolene, Jolene, my DnD queen,
With greatest wisdom i have ever seen


You lead our party with your might,
Through dungeons dark and valleys bright
With your magic spells and trusty sword, Jolene.
You keep us safe and close at heart, 
the paladin, the rogue, the bard,
we trust you with our lives, my queen, Jolene.


Her teeth are sharp, her mouth agape, 
her claws rend flesh, there's no escape,
from the judgement of the Eldritch one, Jolene
Blackening the summer skies, 
with burning wings and countless eyes
we tremble at the sight of you, Jolene


Her skin is pale, her eyes are red, 
her leaden voice commands the dead
to rise and stand beside their dreadful queen
no mortal will excape her thrall 
her hunger will consume us all
and even now i hear her call: Jolene
