How to make your space ship go fast in Blender in 5a easy steps
i love going fast and i like to trick my audience.
Because this space ship is, in fact, not going fast, it's just going up and down. 
What's going fast is this tutorial and those starts flying by. 
So, here's how to recreate this effect
1. grab your spaceship
2. add a circle in front  and fill it up if you need to,
3. then, in the modifier tab, add a particle system to the circle.
4. Switch to the particle properties and play around with the settings. 
5. Add keyframes to your space ship going up and down
The most important ones are The number of emitted particles and their velocity
Congratulations, don't get lost in space
