Hello everyone, and welcome to a new yearlong challenge of getting better at drawing! 
My name is taire and I'm one of the participants in this journey hosted by Marc Brunet. Although I already have some experience with traditional and digital art and even with 3D modeling, I felt it was time to ascend to the next level artwise and get back into the basics.
This is why I'm here to share with you the results of the first month, January, and let me tell you, it's been an exciting start!

# What is the challenge about?

But let me tell you a little about this challenge first. If you already know or maybe participate as well, feel free to skip to the next chapter at this timestamp [timestamp].
This program is hosted by Marc Brunet from Youtube Art School, who worked as a Senior Artist at Blizzard and is busy posting awesome tutorials on Youtube, so I greatly encourage you to check him out. All links are below, and when you're already at Marc's Youtube, go watch his video about this challenge - he's offering a breakdown of all months so you can prepare in advance and get the full picture of where we will be at the end of the year.
In general, each months challenge consists of one exercise that you'll do repeatedly, if possible each day, one or two topics to study and one bigger task. 

For January, this means at least 30 gesture drawings, each one taking between 2 and 5 minutes. The study area consists of perspective basics and shape studies in black and white. The bigger task in January is studying pieces of artists you like. This will help you get a better understanding of what you admire and where you might move in the next year.
