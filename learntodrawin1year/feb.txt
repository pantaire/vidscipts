# Intro

Hello everyone, and welcome back to a new yearlong challenge of getting better at drawing! 
My name is taire and I'm participating in this journey or challenge hosted by Marc Brunet. (link below)
Each month, there are 3 or 4 tasks to help you improve your skills as an artist, so let's look at what we've got for month 2:
80 gestures, 2mins each
anatomy studies of heads and faces
1 scene in 1 point perspective





- kinda unproductive, many days without doing anything
- gesture quality seemed to drop, coming from 5mins down to 2mins - but improved over time
- tried to incorporate head + face studies in some of the gestures
- OG plan was to get better at stylized characters + various face shapes, but i will get back to that next month, as a good procrastinator
- kinda frustrated when gesture drawing, because i KNOW what parts WILL definitely look wonky, but i'm not yet at the point where things are improving - keep on practicing i guess
- also did some drawings of torvi and thorunn from vikings, without a timer, even though half body drawings were not on the schedule - felt really refreshing, i'm doing this for myself
- i tried to make a 3D model of a skull to better understand bone structure of the head and face, helped a little with general understanding
- plan for next month: break down the 4 tasks into smaller tasks and note down ideas as they come, try to do all of them to some extent
