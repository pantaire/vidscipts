10 hours of materials - Blender diary

DAY 1 - brainstorming, theory about basic nodes

Ideas what to create:
- daylight scene: changing light?
- planet system with rotating generated planet materials, maybe with death star?
    - recreate Universal movie opening?
- create soundwaves
- create countdowns like on digital clocks
- portals like in portal2


What i want to know more about:
- texture painting:
    - what resolution?
    - external editors?
    - many textures for the same object?
    - roughness etc. paintable?

- shader nodes
    - how to use
    - randomizing stuff
    - what input is needed? like, pics or fully generatable?
    - animate shader nodes (daylight changing animation?)
    - color modes (color burn, mix, addition, hard light, soften etc)
    - node wrangler addon
    - what node output can go into what input?

- normal maps
    - how to generate
    - usable for retopologizing?

- HDRIs
    - how to capture
    - how to use (view in scene, exchange)
    - visible in background?
    - difference eevee/cycles?

- skin material (realistic)
    - why so hard? cuz complex?
    - generatable or doable with texture painting?

- how to use materials
    - fake users? when saved, when not?
    - duplicate 
    - emission: only for one colour in material?
    - matcaps
    - rainbow colours/textures
    - change materials based on proximity to edge?
    - clay materials for wips

What i learned:
Day 1: 
- think of materials as paint buckets: each object with the same material will change when you change the material
- eevee and cycles will render things HELLA differently, especially things like glass or other transparent stuff. Keep in mind when lookin for tutorials
    - eevee: fakes more things, kinda hard time with transparence, cycles: more grainy, needs more settings tweaked afaik
- you can go really far by simply tweaking BSDF (default) sliders (mainly roughness, specular, emission) without using any nodes. That's what i did since i started with Blender almost a year ago
- not only objects can be edited, world space can be edited too - has influence on objects. backgrounds cannot be applied to single objects, only to world. Makes sense lol
- node types: 
    - texture coordinate: UV layout
    - color ramp: change sharpness of shadows, create gradients by tweaking RGB values. plug texture coordinate (generated) -> fac to create 
        - change linear/constant etc for different edge shapes (sharp, smooth)
        - add sliders for greater variance
    - noise texture: randomize stuff, change detail, roughness etc
    - voronoi texture: cellular, organic shapes, grid lines by changing random, scale and mode
        - put texture coord (uv) -> vector to create planet guidelines (lat + longitude lines)
    - mix rgb: mixes not only colours, can also transition between 2 modes (noise texture (fac) -> color1 and boronoi (distance) -> color2), transition with fac)
    - bump: can simulate height, uses black and white. only affects white areas, use black to not apply effect
    - put everything into normal principled bsdf

Day 2: 
- what does bsdf stand for?
- play around with skills from day 1, maybe create fist planets?
